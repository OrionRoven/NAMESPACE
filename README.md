### Concise project description:

A Blackjack game against the computer. Each player is dealt 2 cards to begin with and the user is given the option to hit or stand. If hit, the user draws another card and until they stand or the value of their hand exceeds 21, in which case they lose. If the user stands, the computer hits until the value of their hand exceeds 16, but if the value exceeds 21, the user wins. If both the user and computer stand at 21 or less, whoever has the greater hand value wins.
